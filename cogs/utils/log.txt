How to play minigames
Heist
Heist is a luck based game where you and up to 20 people enter an imaginary situation of a raid. Most will die or be captured, but the victor(s) will recieve a hefty sum of credits. To begin a heist, use the command 
>heist play
. Up to 20 people can use the command within 1 minute to join the heist.
You may be captured or killed during the heist. Don't worry! If you are captured, you can either wait it out for about 20 minutes or you can use the command 
>heist bailout
 to bail yourself out with credits. You can also bail others out. However, if you are bailed out and recaptured in another heist, the cost for bail will increase. If you decide to wait, once your time is up you will be able to use the command 
>heist release
 and you will be released from jail!
If you are killed, you must wait a certain amount of time before reviving yourself. To revive, use the command 
>heist revive
 after your time is up.
Russian Roulette
Russian Roulette is also a luck based game. You can play with up to 6 players, and there is a 16% chance of you dying each turn. To play, use the command 
>rr (bet)
. If you are the last one standing, you will recieve the entire pool of money.
Trivia
Test your knowledge! No credits are involved in this game. To start a trivia game, simply use the command 
>trivia (topic)
. To see a list of topics, use the command 
>trivia list
. To stop a trivia, use the command 
>trivia stop
. To submit your own topic, go to https://goo.gl/forms/HohNZpriomGpd02N2.

Hello once again Discord API, so this time I can't seem to get this too work so I'm trying to get a role which is specified when they type a command which doesn't seem to work
```var arguments = cmd.replace('setDefaultRole', '');
            if (arguments === '' || arguments == null) return msg.channel.send('Incorrect syntax, use \'!\' for help using commands.');
            arguments = arguments.split(' ');
            console.log(arguments + "\n" + msg.guild.roles.array());
            var rank = msg.guild.roles.get("name", arguments[1].replace('_', ' '));
            if (rank != null) {
                fs.readFile('./settings.json', 'utf8', function(err,data){
                    if (err) return console.log(err);
                    var id = guild.id;
                    object = JSON.parse(data);
                    object.forEach(function(e){
                        if(e.id == msg.guild.id) {
                            e.defaultRank = rank;
                        }
                    });
                    var json = JSON.stringify(object);
                    fs.writeFile('./settings.json', json, 'utf8', function(){});
                });
            } else {
                msg.channel.send("The rank "+arguments[1].replace("_"," ")+" was not found.");
            }```

I forgot that PHP framework composer line
```js
client.guilds.get(message.guild.id).roles.find("name" "roleName");```
that's how you find a role
```js
client.guilds.get(message.guild.id).roles.get("ID");```

Yes
Yea
Client.on("ready", () => {
    client.user.setGame('type ,help for amazing stuff');`
    some other code;
});
thats an error
client.user.setGame('type','help for amazing stuff');
